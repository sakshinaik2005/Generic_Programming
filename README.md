# Generic_Programming
A generic programming repository contains reusable, type-independent code, such as templates, functions, and classes, designed to work with multiple data types. It promotes modularity, reduces duplication, and improves code efficiency by allowing developers to write flexible, maintainable, and scalable programs.
